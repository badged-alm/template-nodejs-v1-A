This is a simple node.js project configuration with built-in good practices plugins to improve teamwork. It packs **Jest** for functional testing and test coverage (with **Coveralls** history) and it is using **ESLint** as linter with **Prettier** plugin for having consistent code. Also integrates **Snyk** to keep track and fix possible dependency vulnerability issues. It has an active **GitHub Actions** workflow for node.js testing and it follows **Conventional Commits** standard.
